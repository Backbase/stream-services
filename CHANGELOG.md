## [2.33.0]
### Added
- Add 'build-helper-maven-plugin' for adding the generated sources (i.e. Openapi) as project's source directories.

## [2.32.0]
### Added
- added lock identity user on creation flag.
> New conditionally mandatory property added in legal entity stream: `backbase.stream.identity.identity-integration-base-url` to indicate BackBase Identity base URL for clients that integrate with it. This property must be defined when: `backbase.stream.legalentity.sink.use-identity-integration=true`

## [2.31.0]
### Changed
- Fixing the function group delete to only happen when it is not template type (this is when using referenceJobRoles )

## [2.30.0]
### Changed
- Fixing NullPointerException while creating data group using products i.e. without custom data group id

## [2.29.0]
### Changed
- Checking the response recieved from Legal entity api , user  api to is2xxSuccessful as it  returns 207 response for success.

## [2.28.0]
### Changed
- Add "Custom Data Group Items" to Product Groups, require either Products or Custom Data Group Items (previously just Products)

## [2.27.0]
### Fixed
- Fix for issue https://github.com/Backbase/stream-services-2.0/issues/46
```
While deleting a legal entity , we are trying to get user information by sending an internal id to
service-api/v2/users/externalids/{externlaIId}?skipHierarchyCheck=true instead of /service-api/v2/users/{internalId}.
The service-api/v2/users/externalids/{externlaIId}?skipHierarchyCheck=true returns 404 user not found as it is an internal ID and the deleting of the user fails.
```

## [2.26.0]
### Changed
- Fix for null point exception when no users are informed during the legal entity bootstrap.
- Enhancements in utility for aggregating all products of a product group.
- Enhanced the documentation for Service Agreements endpoints.

## [2.25.0]
### Added
- Included possibility to use Custom Service Agreements. From now on, if a custom service agreement is declared, and a master service agreement is not explicitly declared, that legal entity will have a custom service agreement only. If none are declared a default master service agreement is created. e.g.:
```yaml
bootstrap:
  legalEntity:
    name: "Backbase Bank"
    realmName: "backbase"
    externalId: "backbase-bank"
    legalEntityType: "BANK"
    customServiceAgreement:
      name: "backbase-bank"
      description: "backbase bank custom service agreement"
      externalId: "sa_backbase-bank"
      jobRoles:
        - name: SUUS
          description: Manager of the online helpdesk and processing teams, able to set up/edit contracts, add accounts etc. Also able to set up Broadcast messages
          functionGroups:
            - name: "Manage Entitlements"
              functions:
                - functionId: "1019"
                  functionCode: "manage.data.groups"
                  privileges:
                    - privilege: "view"
                    - privilege: "create"
                    - privilege: "edit"
                    - privilege: "delete"
                    - privilege: "approve"
```
- Created Service Agreement endpoint do updated an existing service agreement. e.g. add more participants to it.
> - PUT <legal-entity-http>/service-agreement
> - PUT <legal-entity-http>/async/service-agreement
> - GET <legal-entity-http>/async/service-agreement/{unitOfWorkId}

## [2.24.0]

- Upgrade to BOAT 0.14.0

## [2.22.0]

## [2.21.0]
### Fixed

## [2.20.0]

## [2.18.0]
### Changed
- Upgrade plugins `maven-surefire-plugin` and `maven-failsafe-plugin`

## [2.17.0]
### Fixed
- Fix for issue Product Catalog creation fails when either kinds or types are nullCLOSED (Product Catalog null pointer when either kinds or types are null)
- Fix for issue Dependency conflict for org.yaml.snakeyamlCLOSED  (dependency conflicts)
- Fix for null pointer in UserProfileMapper when additional emails/phones are null

## [2.16.0]
### Fixed
- Fix in pipelines (Github Actions) and compile with JDK 11

### Added
- Added UserProfile support (for DBS service user-profile-manager) in Legal Entity SAGA.
It’s disabled by default and can be enabled by setting flag backbase.stream.legalentity.sink.userProfileEnabled to true.
It’s implemented as a nested object under User model, and it will use some of its properties (like fullName, email and phoneNumber) when constructing the UserProfile DBS resource.
It performs an upsert so it supports both creation and update.
Example:

```yaml
- user:
    externalId: sara
    fullName: Sara Jones
    identityLinkStrategy: CREATE_IN_IDENTITY
    emailAddress:
      address: sara@email.com
    mobileNumber:
      number: '1234567890'
    userProfile:
      title: Miss
      personalInformation:
        gender: female
        dateOfBirth: '1995-12-30'
        countryOfBirth: Netherlands
      locale: nl-NL
      additionalEmails:
        - value: sara2@email.com
        - value: sara3@email.com
      additionalPhoneNumbers:
        - value: '012121212'
        - value: '01313713'
      addresses:
        - streetAddress: Fake Street 123
          locality: Utrecht
          country: Netherlands
          type: home
          primary: 'true'
```

## [2.15.0]
### Fixed
- Fixed implementation of Reference Job Roles where we can assign a list of reference job roles to a specific user. 
  * Example with legal-entity-bootstrap-task on how to create a Reference Job Role in the root legal entity and assign it to a user below the hierarchy (example with a subsidiary):
```yaml
bootstrap:
  legalEntity:
    name: "Backbase Bank"
    realmName: "backbase"
    externalId: "backbase-bank"
    legalEntityType: "BANK"
    referenceJobRoles:
      - name: "Entitlements - Manager"
        description: "Full Entitlements administration."
        functionGroups:
          - name: "Manage Entitlements"
            functions:
              - functionId: "1019"
                functionCode: "manage.data.groups"
                privileges:
                  - privilege: "view"
                  - privilege: "create"
                  - privilege: "edit"
                  - privilege: "delete"
                  - privilege: "approve"
              - functionId: "1020"
                functionCode: "manage.function.groups"
                privileges:
                  - privilege: "view"
                  - privilege: "create"
                  - privilege: "edit"
                  - privilege: "delete"
                  - privilege: "approve"
    administrators:
      - externalId: "bbadmin"
        fullname: "Backbase Root Admin"
        identityLinkStrategy: "CREATE_IN_IDENTITY"
        emailAddress:
          address: "bbadmin@email.com"
        mobileNumber:
          number: "1234567890"
    users:
      - user:
          externalId: "bbadmin"
        referenceJobRoleNames:
          - "Entitlements - Manager"
    subsidiaries:
      - name: "Backbase Subsidiary"
        realmName: "backbase"
        externalId: "backbase-sub"
        legalEntityType: "BANK"
        administrators:
          - externalId: "bbsubadmin"
            fullname: "Backbase Subsidiary Admin"
            identityLinkStrategy: "CREATE_IN_IDENTITY"
            emailAddress:
              address: "bbsubadmin@email.com"
            mobileNumber:
              number: "1234567890"
        users:
          - user:
              externalId: "bbsubadmin"
            referenceJobRoleNames:
              - "Entitlements - Manager"
